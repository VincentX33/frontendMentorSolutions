## My process

Learning from my previous mistakes, I designed the box first and then did the positioning. Took longer than needed due to a bug in my gitHub page setup, but this one went really smooth. Partly lost time due to the need of trial and error in setting up background colors for elements
### Built with
- html5 markup
- css flexbox for arranging inner and outer elements
- github pages for deployment
